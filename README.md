# docker-course-2
Complex docker app, running a fibonacci sequence worker with database, cache, webserver, and api

## More docker use

What I have learnt from this:

- How much I love docker / docker-compose - WOW
- how much fun you can have watching docker going ballistic building and mounting all 6 containers after typing just docker-compose up --build

seriously:

- first use of postgres
- first practical use of redis
- rewrote the client to use react functional component and useState hook
- added sorting and wrote a pruning algorithm to remove duplicate indexes
- added a little css to neaten up the front end.
- had to do a fair amount of debugging of the api and postgres enviroment variables to get things working properly
